# prorl-train
This repository implements a Proximal Reinforcement Learning (ProRL) training loop for causal language models such as GPT-2. It supports multi-sample reward optimization, group advantage normalization (GRPO), and KL-regularized PPO-style loss, with strong emphasis on numerical stability and reproducibility.
